# Practicum Final Project
https://namernews.students.nomoredomainssbs.ru/

# Tech Used #
HTML5, CSS3, Node.js Runtime Environment, React.Js Frame Work, JSX, Api, MongoDb, Git, Nginx (together with Pm2 and Cerbot), Google Cloud Virtual Machine Instance  

# Project Stages
- Stage I : Back End construction, briefly done - with the controls through out Postman.
- Stage II: A deep and multi-layered React.Js Application Implementation. Especially additional design requirement for Mobile Version. This was the longest part of my journey through-out the completion of the project.  I literally had to relearn the React.Js actually have to learn deep to follow up the hiearchy of props from parent to child. Multiple popups provided that journey, was hard but learnt lot.
- Stage III: A need to create a documentation for self projects discovered. The flow of data and the puzzle solving at each step was dense, tiring, long but in the end a great learning experience.
Safe copying the project to VM throughout build over front end. Connecting newsApi service to the project to search news as cards and save those the user interested. A though journey but let me learn a lot.

# Project Notes 
- This project is in broader scope with including many tricks we learned since Sprint 1 till Sprint 15.  From css implementations to html, from js logic than importing that logic to react.jsx. 
- Understanding structure of web building, laying foundations with HTML tags. Styling them with CSS, then adding responsive layout with the knowledge of CSS and having a brilliant News App responsing to tablet, mobile and desktop viewports.
- The brilliance moment, and also the moment of realization that the project is really deep is the need of using flex display with column direction, making the column in reverse-column to match the Figma Design.
- Following the Figma Design build the React App Implementation initiated.
